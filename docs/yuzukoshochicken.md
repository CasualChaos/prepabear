## Yuzu Kosho Chicken 
This one just sounded fun.

For the green here I've used sliced cucumber, but honestly anything, sliced cabbage, lettuced, fried green beans.
Serve with rice and your choice of green.

Servings: 2


### Ingredients
- 250g chicken breast or thigh, diced
- 1-2 tbsp Sesame oil
- 1/2 cucumber, sliced
- 2 stalks green onion, diced (optional)
- Sesame seeds

#### Sauce
- 2 tsp Yuzu Kosho
- 1 tbsp Soy Sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

#### Instructions
1. Chuck your diced chicken in a bowl and add the sauce ingredients. Mix well and let sit for 10-15min to marinate.
2. Head a small pan on medium heat and add sesame oil. Once it's hot add your chicken and sear for 4-5min on one side before flipping.
3. If you have a lid cover the pot for 3-4 minutes to let the chicken steam a bit. Otherwise just cook for an extra minute or so.
4. Plate with rice and greens. Add some green onion and sesame seeds as a garnish if you'd like.
Serve!
