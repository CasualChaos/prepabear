## Mapo Tofu
Mapo Tofu is a Chinese dish from Sichuan Province. I chose it because it's an uncomplicated stir-fry.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup oil (divided)
- 1-2 fresh Thai bird chili peppers (thinly sliced)
- 6-8 dried red chilies (roughly chopped)
- 0.5- 1.5 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns (powdered or finely ground, reserving 1/4 teaspoon for garnish at the end; if you want a milder flavor use 1/2 or 1 teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorn)
- 3 tablespoons ginger (finely minced)
- 3 tablespoons garlic (finely minced)
- 225 g ground pork
- 1-2 tablespoons spicy bean sauce (depending on your desired salt/spice levels)
- 155 ml low sodium chicken broth (or water)
- 450 g silken tofu (cut into 2.5cm cubes)
- 0.25 cup water
- 1.5 teaspoons cornstarch
- 0.25 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
- 0.25 teaspoon sugar (optional)
- 1 scallion (finely chopped)
