## Mapo Tofu
Mapo Tofu is a Chinese dish from Sichuan Province. I chose it because it's an uncomplicated stir-fry. Serve with rice.

Servings: 5-6

### Ingredients

- 2 x 1/4 cups neutral oil
- 1-2 fresh Thai bird chili peppers, thinly sliced
- 6-8 dried red chilies, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon (or to taste) Sichuan peppercorns, finely ground
- 3 tablespoons ginger, minced
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 225 g ground pork
- 1-2 tablespoons doubanjiang
- 155 ml chicken broth (or water)
- 450 g silken tofu (cut into 2.5cm cubes)
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch

#### Garnish, optional
- 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, finely ground
- 1 scallion, sliced

### Instructions

##### First up
Mix your half cup of water and cornstarch together in a small bowl and set aside.

1. Start a small pan on a low heat and add 1/4 cup of oil. Add your peppers (fresh and dried).Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don’t burn. Set the oil and chilis to the side or in a small bowl. 
2. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil in your pan over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry it until it’s cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds, taking care to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does.
3. Add the doubanjiang to the mixture and stir well. Then add the chicken broth and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. 
4. Give the cornstarch and water a quick stir to recombine and add to the pan. Once the sauce starts to thicken add the set aside chili oil, peppers and all.
5. Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil, sugar and scallions. Stir until the scallions are just wilted. 
6. Sprinkle some more ground sichuan peppercorns if you want.
Serve!
