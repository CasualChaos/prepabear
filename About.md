This is a companion site the to the little East Asian Spicy Kit I put together.

Some additional notes:
- I swear to god if you keep cooking rice "the French way" I will come to your house to inflict violence on you. I will add instruction here later.
- 1 part soy sauce, 1 part oyster sauce, a little sesame oil, garlic and some chili flakes. Stir fry anything. So quick and incredible. 
- Something else, I forgot. I'll add it later.



This site was made using <a href="https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs">Just the Docs</a>, a documentation theme for Jekyll.
