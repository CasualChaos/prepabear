# Bon anniversaire!

So...
You've been saying you want to try cooking more and you like East Asian food. 
I've put together some chili and spices I thought you might not have and some recipes they go in. 

## What's Included

### Doubanjiang
Pixian 

### Sichuan Peppercorns 
China, Sichuan Province. I could only find whole peppercorns on short notice, but the flavor keeps better anyway. 

### Gochugaru
Korean red pepper powder. 
I thought you might already have gochujang, so I went with gochugaru. Mild to moderate korean chili powder. Here I've included a garlic chili noodle recipe to use it in, but just add it to stuff for a little bit of spice.


### Soy Sauce
I went for a small bottle of light soy sauce. It's flexible and will be in basically every asian dish.

### Sesame Oil
I'm hoping you don't already have a bottle. But this can and should go on everything. Stir fry, ramen, instant noodles, fried rice. 

### Yuzu Kosho 
Japanese. A paste made from yuzu, japanese citrus, chili peppers and salt. 
Turns out it's really hard to find on short notice. But I found a place I could get some online.
